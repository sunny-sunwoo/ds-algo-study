 * Q5. Ocean Border(BFS with memoization)
 * Given an m x n matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a continent, 
 * the "Pacific ocean" touches the left and top edges of the matrix and the "Atlantic ocean" 
 * touches the right and bottom edges.
 * 
 * Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a cell 
 * to another one with height equal or lower.
 * 
 * Find the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean.
